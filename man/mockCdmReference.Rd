\title{Creates an empty CDM (Common Data Model) reference for a mock database.}
\usage{
mockCdmReference(cdmName = "mock database", vocabularySet = "mock")
}
\arguments{
\item{cdmName}{A character string specifying the name of the CDM object to
be created.This name can be used to identify the CDM object
within a larger simulation or testing framework. Default is
"mock database".}

\item{vocabularySet}{A character string specifying the name of the vocabulary set
to be used when creating the vocabulary tables for the CDM.
Options are "mock" or "eunomia":
\itemize{
\item "mock": Provides a very small synthetic vocabulary subset,
suitable for tests that do not require realistic vocabulary
names or relationships.
\item "eunomia": Uses the vocabulary from the Eunomia test database,
which contains real vocabularies available from ATHENA.
}}
}
\value{
Returns a CDM object that is initially empty but includes mock
vocabulary tables.The object structure is compliant with OMOP CDM
standards, making it suitable for further population with mock data
like person, visit, and observation records.
}
\description{
This function initializes an empty CDM reference with a specified name and
populates it with mock vocabulary tables based on the provided vocabulary
set. It is particularly useful for setting up a simulated environment for
testing and development purposes within the OMOP CDM framework.

\examples{
library(omock)

# Create a new empty mock CDM reference
cdm <- mockCdmReference()

# Display the structure of the newly created CDM
cdm
